  "status": "Fail",
  "total_score": 34.0,
  "ai_reason": "The resume received a Fail status due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Education Quality and Relevance**: \n   - The candidate is currently pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology, which is relevant to the fields of Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning, and NLP. However, there is no GPA provided, which could be a critical metric for evaluating academic performance, especially for a junior candidate with limited professional experience.\n\n2. **Professional Experience Depth and Relevance**: \n   - There is a complete absence of professional experience listed. For a candidate seeking opportunities in research and machine learning, having some form of internship or work experience is crucial to demonstrate practical application of skills and knowledge.\n\n3. **Project Quality and Impact**: \n   - While the candidate has listed projects, the descriptions lack specific outcomes or measurable impacts. The project on \"GoLLIE\" is more academic in nature, and the \"Data-related Projects\" are personal projects without clear evidence of real-world application or impact. Additionally, there are no links or references to these projects, which could provide further validation of the work done.\n\n4. **Skills Alignment with Requirements**: \n   - The skills listed are relevant to the candidate's field of interest. However, without professional experience, it is difficult to assess the depth of these skills. The resume would benefit from more context on how these skills have been applied in practical settings.\n\n5. **Other Relevant Factors**:\n   - The resume lacks a clear location, which could be important for potential employers considering logistical aspects of hiring.\n   - The certifications from Google are relevant and add value, but without professional experience, they may not be sufficient to demonstrate the candidate's capability to apply these skills in a work environment.\n\nOverall, the resume fails to provide sufficient evidence of practical experience and impact, which are critical for a candidate seeking to enter a competitive field like machine learning and data analysis."
