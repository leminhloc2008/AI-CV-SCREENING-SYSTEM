This major is relevant to roles in data analysis, economics, and business, aligning with some of the professional experiences listed.\n   - The high GPA of 9.6 from a prestigious high school for the gifted indicates strong academic performance, which is a positive indicator of the candidate's capability and dedication.\n\n2. **Professional Experience Depth and Relevance:**\n   - The candidate has diverse professional experiences across different sectors, including sales, external relations, education, and data analytics. This breadth of experience demonstrates adaptability and a broad skill set.\n   - The role at ABBOTT LAB as a STEM Highschool Intern is particularly relevant to data-driven roles, as it involved data mining, analytics, and the use of BI tools, which are valuable skills in many industries.\n   - However, some roles lack specific details on duration and seniority, which makes it difficult to fully assess the depth of experience.\n\n3. **Project Quality and Impact:**\n   - The projects listed, such as \"LOTH\" and \"SUGAR VIETNAM,\" show a commitment to social impact and community service, which is commendable. These projects demonstrate leadership and organizational skills, as well as the ability to manage and execute initiatives with tangible outcomes.\n   - The impact of these projects, such as raising funds and supporting education for underprivileged students, adds value to the candidate's profile.\n\n4. **Skills Alignment with Requirements:**\n   - The candidate lists a range of technical and soft skills, including proficiency in Google Suite, Microsoft Office, and project management, which are applicable to many professional environments.\n   - Language skills in English, Vietnamese, and Dutch indicate cultural adaptability and communication skills, although the intermediate level in English may be a limitation depending on the role's requirements.\n\n5. **Other Relevant Factors:**\n   - The candidate has received several scholarships and awards, which highlight academic excellence and recognition in competitive environments. This is a strong indicator of potential and capability.\n   - The lack of a detailed introduction and incomplete contact information (e.g., missing LinkedIn profile) may hinder networking opportunities and the ability to present a comprehensive professional image.\n\nOverall, the candidate's strong academic background, diverse professional experiences, and commitment to impactful projects make them a viable candidate, but the lack of detailed information in some areas and intermediate English proficiency may require further consideration depending on the specific role requirements."
