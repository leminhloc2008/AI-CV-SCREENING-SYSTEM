  "status": "Fail",
  "total_score": 34.75,
  "ai_reason": "The resume received a Fail status due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Education Quality and Relevance**: While the candidate is pursuing a degree in Marketing Management, which is relevant, the lack of a completed degree (expected in 2024) may be a concern for roles requiring a completed education. The additional courses in data analysis and SQL are beneficial but do not compensate for the absence of a completed degree.\n\n2. **Professional Experience Depth and Relevance**: The candidate has relevant internships and experience in marketing and data analytics. However, the roles are primarily internships and entry-level, which may not demonstrate sufficient depth or long-term impact in the field. The lack of seniority in the Content Writer role also suggests limited professional growth.\n\n3. **Project Quality and Impact**: There are no projects listed, which could have demonstrated the candidate's ability to apply their skills in real-world scenarios and showcase their impact on specific marketing campaigns or strategies.\n\n4. **Skills Alignment with Requirements**: The skills listed are relevant to marketing and data analysis, but the resume lacks specific achievements or metrics that demonstrate the effective application of these skills. Additionally, the skills are quite general and do not highlight any unique competencies that set the candidate apart.\n\n5. **Other Relevant Factors**: The absence of awards, certifications, and a LinkedIn profile may indicate a lack of professional recognition and networking, which are important in the marketing field. The resume also lacks specific achievements or quantifiable results in the professional experience section, which are crucial for demonstrating impact and effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the resume lacks depth in professional experience, completed education, and demonstrable achievements, which are critical for a passing evaluation."
